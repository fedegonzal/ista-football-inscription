# ISTA football automated inscription

Since many people waits hundreds of hours to get a spot in the next football game, I decided to automate the inscription process. This script will automatically inscribe you in the next game once the inscription is open, without any effort.

## How to use

Prefered with Chrome, but it should work with any browser (I didn't test it with other browsers).

Do it every Fridat at 7:00 AM before the inscription opens.

1. Open WhatsApp Web (the web version, not the app)
2. Open the chat with the ISTA football group
3. Open the console (right click -> inspect -> console)
4. Paste the code from index.js and press enter

Do not change the chat to another chat until the inscription is done. If you want to use WhatsApp while the script is running, use your phone!

## Warranty

No warranty is provided. Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage caused by this script (mainly hurting someone's feelings because you took their spot).
