# ISTA football automated inscription

Since many people waits hundreds of hours to get a spot in the next football game, I decided to automate the inscription process. This script will automatically inscribe you in the next game once the inscription is open, without any effort.

## How to use

Prefered with Chrome, but it should work with any browser (I didn't test it with other browsers).

Do it every Friday at 7:00 AM before the inscription opens:

1. Open WhatsApp Web (the web version, not the app)
2. Open the chat with the ISTA winter football group
3. Open the console (right click -> inspect -> console)
4. Paste the code from index.js into the console, and press enter

You can copy and paste the code from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fedegonzal/ista-football-inscription/refs/heads/main/index.js

Do not change the chat to another chat until the inscription is done. If you want to use WhatsApp while the script is running, use your phone!

## How it works

The script will monitor the football group chat for new messages, once a new message has the "+1" string, the script will write "+1" for you. After that, the script is unloaded automatically, no more messages will be monitored, and you can use WhatsApp normally with your browser.

## Warranty

No warranty is provided. Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage caused by this script (mainly hurting someone's feelings because you took their spot).

## Helpdesk

You can ask me if you need help to run the script, just send me a message on WhatsApp before the next game inscription opens :)
